# http-files-server
This project is about improving my previous codecrafters-http-server. Here I will try to create a server that can share files if requested on the LAN.


This server is able to:
- Run on Linux and Windows
- Find out its IP address automatically
- send HTML's with CSS and Javascript
- pull a .txt file and combining it with a template HTML and CSS with it
- download any files (not folders for now) in the ./files/downloads folder
- creating a file in the downloads folder via POST method

This first iteration is not perfect and there is a lot to improve.
- [ ] Polishing the code

Features soon to be added:
- [ ] Logging information capabilities
- [ ] Adding the ability to download folders (for now the server could only access single files and not folders within a specific folder)
